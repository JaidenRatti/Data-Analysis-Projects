# Strava Data Analysis

Analyzing my live Strava cycling data with python and Strava's API (wanted customizable insight into my rides).

Visually displaying data with pandas, graphing with matplotlib & calplot, and plotting a geomap with polyline & folium. Geomap is not interactive on GitHub (takes too long to render) so I've uploaded a sample picture instead.
